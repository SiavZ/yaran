// The phone's typing surface: a real textarea with native keyboard assistance
// on, buffering the message locally, plus a Send that delivers it in one write.
// Typing straight into xterm's hidden textarea is hostile on a phone, where
// autocorrect, swipe and IMEs fight an input that must stay raw.
//
// Presentational and thin: this owns only the textarea's autosizing and emits
// `onSend(text)`. The buffer is controlled and lives in TerminalPane, so
// unmounting the bar never destroys in-progress text, and every behavior
// (payload encoding, ownership gating, PTY writes) lives there and in
// `lib/composebar`.
//
// Enter inserts a newline; only Send delivers. The one class of physical key
// intercepted is the keys a textarea has no meaning for, Escape and F1-F12,
// forwarded through `onForwardKey`.

  // The buffered message text, owned by the parent (controlled input).
  value: string
  // Buffer edits, and the post-send clear: a successful send routes through
  // `onChange("")` rather than mutating the DOM value, or the controlled
  // value would desync and the cleared text would reappear on the next
  // parent re-render.
  onChange: (text: string) => void
  // Fire the buffered text (possibly empty: an empty Send means "press
  // Enter", how the user confirms a TUI menu/prompt without focusing xterm).
  // The parent encodes the payload and performs the PTY write. Returns
  // whether the send actually happened: on true the buffer is cleared, on
  // false (not the owner, socket down, oversized message) it is KEPT so the
  // user can retry, with the parent toasting the reason.
  onSend: (text: string) => boolean
  // The parent's handle on the textarea, so the tap-to-focus redirect (and
  // any focus bookkeeping) can target it without reaching into the DOM. A

  // rendered without an opinion is sitting under.
  placeholder?: string
  // Forward the bytes of a physical key the textarea has no meaning for
  // (Escape and F1-F12, decided by `composeHardwareKeyForwards`) to the PTY: a
  // tablet with a keyboard case keeps the compose bar up, and its hardware Esc
  // must interrupt a running agent the way the accessory Esc key does. The
  // parent routes it through that key's own write helper, which owns the
  // ownership gate. Without it every keystroke keeps native textarea behavior.

//! Leaving when the terminal is gone.
//!
//! A TUI's terminal can disappear underneath it: the window is closed, the SSH
//! connection drops, the terminal emulator is killed. The kernel hangs the tty
//! up and sends SIGHUP, and the user expects what they expect of any terminal
//! program, which is that it ends.
//!
//! Two things here make that true:
//!
//! - [`wait_for_terminal_input`] is how the run loop waits for a key. It
//!   reports a hung-up terminal as [`TerminalInput::Gone`], so the loop quits
//!   instead of handing a dead tty to crossterm. Crossterm's reader has no way
//!   out of one: a read of zero bytes, or any error but `WouldBlock`, sends its
//!   loop round again, forever, and the run loop that polls the shutdown flag
//!   never gets the thread back.
//! - [`QuitWatchdog`] is the backstop. It watches the same shutdown flag from
//!   its own thread, and if a quit was asked for and the run loop has not left
//!   within the grace, it ends the process. Whatever the main thread is stuck
//!   in, a signal that asks yaran to quit is never just swallowed.

//! Yaran peer router: agent-to-agent message routing between Yaran sessions, and
//! the globally locked AMQ registry lifecycle that keeps every Yaran store's
//! agent handles unique inside one shared AMQ root.
//!
//! Ported from the fork's monolithic `src/peer.rs`. The logic lives here, in
//! `yaran-core`, so both surfaces can use it: the TUI and the web server run the
//! startup reconciliation ([`sync_amq_agents_for_bootstrap`]), every agent
//! launch exports the session identity ([`append_session_env`]), and the
//! `yaran peer` CLI ([`run_peer`]) is dispatched from the binary's argument
//! router.
//!
//! The router speaks in [`PeerSession`], a small projection of
//! [`crate::model::AgentSession`] (its persisted immutable `agent_handle`,
//! `shared_workspace` flag and soft-delete state). Everything the router
//! decides is a function of that projection, and the one place that builds
//! it from the session store is [`session_store`].

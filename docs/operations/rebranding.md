# Yaran rebrand and upgrade compatibility

Yaran is the product name. `yaran` is the executable, and `yaran-core`, `yaran-tui`, and `yaran-web` are the workspace crates. The optional shell overlay lives in `yaran-amq/`. Provider wrapper commands such as `claude-amq`, `codex-amq`, `gemini-amq`, and `jcode-amq` keep their names.

The project builds on Patrick D'Appollonio's dux. Its MIT license, copyright, upstream attribution, and captured historical evidence remain intact. Yaran does not claim ownership of upstream's domain, newsletter, npm packages, or Homebrew tap.

## Existing configuration and sessions

No automatic directory move or data deletion is part of this rebrand.

- `YARAN_HOME` is the primary configuration override. `DUX_HOME` remains a fallback only when `YARAN_HOME` is absent. A present but empty or relative new override is an error, not permission to fall back to a different workspace.
- Fresh defaults are `~/.yaran` on macOS and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yaran` on Linux, or `~/.config/yaran` when the XDG override is absent or relative.
- Without a home override, an initialized Yaran home wins. Otherwise an existing dux home is reused in place. A configuration file, session database, store identity, or populated worktree directory identifies initialized state. Empty new directories do not hide legacy state.
- If both homes have state, select the intended one explicitly. Discovery does not merge databases or worktrees.
- The configuration filename, SQLite database, session IDs, provider histories, and stored paths retain their existing formats. No provider's history directory is renamed.
- The internal lock remains `dux.lock`. Both executables must lock the same file when pointed at one workspace, including during a mixed-version rollout. This compatibility filename is not a second product name.

Other `YARAN_*` runtime inputs follow the same new-first, legacy-fallback policy. Child agents receive both new and legacy identity/settings aliases so previously installed wrappers still work. A new-name user setting wins if both names are configured.

## Durable artifacts and browser preferences

Some internal names deliberately remain stable rather than being rewritten:

- Existing AMQ inboxes use the established `dux-amq` data namespace. Resolved queue paths are exported as `YARAN_AMQ_QUEUE_DIR` and `DUX_AMQ_QUEUE_DIR`, so Rust and shell helpers share one queue.
- AMQ ownership markers retain `.dux-amq-source`. Wrappers also recognize the newer spelling without moving or unlinking an existing marker.
- The managed project worktree link and git exclude entries retain their established names. Renaming a live symlink would invalidate saved paths and upstream tooling.
- Existing `.dux/uploads` or `.dux-uploads` directories are reused when the new default would otherwise create a separate upload directory. Explicitly configured paths are unchanged.
- Existing `dux.log` is reused when there is no `yaran.log`. New homes use the new log name.
- Built-in `dux_dark` and `dux-dark` theme aliases still resolve. A user-owned theme file wins before a built-in alias, and loading a legacy config does not rewrite its theme name.

Browser preference reads consult the new Yaran key first, then its legacy dux key. Promotion copies values without deleting the legacy preference. An explicit reset removes both names so old values cannot return after reset. This applies on the same browser origin. Moving to another hostname or port does not transfer local storage automatically.

## Build flags and releases

`YARAN_DISABLE_UI_BUILD` is the current frontend escape hatch. Legacy `DUX_DISABLE_UI_BUILD` is consulted only when it is absent. Setting the new flag to an empty value enables the normal frontend build even if the old skip flag is set. Both old and new placeholder-page markers are recognized, and CI guards reject either brand's externally supplied skip/state markers.

New release tags are **`yaran-vX.Y.Z`**. New archives are `yaran-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz`, containing the `yaran` executable. The display version remains `vX.Y.Z`; current release-note lookup maps it to the Yaran tag. Explicit historical tag lookups remain exact.

The Cloud Connect and phone-app release trains use `yaran-cloud-vX.Y.Z` and `yaran-mobile-vX.Y.Z` tags, never a `dux-` name, and do not change binary release naming: the `yaran` archives ship only on `yaran-v*` releases, and `install.sh` installs the newest `yaran-v*` release because the other trains are never marked as the latest release.

Published `dux-amq-v*` tags, original archive/member names, and checksums are immutable provenance. Pinning one of those tags must still request its original archive bytes, not fabricate a Yaran archive at the old URL. The overlay's pinned legacy release is an explicit compatibility bootstrap, not a newly published Yaran release.

## Hosted repository

The existing GitHub repository was renamed in place to `SiavZ/yaran` on October 3, 2026. Its repository ID, branches, historical release tags, asset IDs, filenames, sizes, and published digests remained unchanged. Current source, issue, documentation, release API, and installer-default URLs use the new address.

The previous `SiavZ/dux-amq-setup` address is a legacy redirect, not a separate repository. Do not recreate a repository under that old name, because doing so would replace GitHub's redirect. Existing `DUX_REPO` overrides remain accepted, including the original address. Captured historical evidence retains the coordinates it actually measured.

Existing clones can update their remote without moving their checkout:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SiavZ/yaran.git
```

## Remaining external steps

1. Publish and verify a first `yaran-vX.Y.Z` release containing the new executable and real web UI before advertising a new-brand binary install. Until then, build with `cargo install --path crates/yaran --locked`.
2. Choose and deploy a website origin. Set `YARAN_SITE_URL` for that deployment. The repository's website sources do not establish ownership of a public domain.
3. Create a Yaran npm package or Homebrew formula only if those distribution channels are wanted. The local npm wrapper is private, and upstream installers still install upstream dux.
4. Rename this checkout directory only after all running agents and shells stop using its current absolute path. The hosted rename leaves the live working directory untouched.

Captured audits, port-validation reports, measurement logs, original release-note fixtures, and historical upstream blog content retain their original terminology and source URLs. They describe what was actually measured or published, not current Yaran branding.

## Verification on October 3, 2026

These checks ran locally on macOS arm64, rather than relying only on renamed source text:

- Complete CLI and core unit, integration, and documentation suites passed. The actual build script was exercised with new and legacy release flags, including conflicting and explicitly empty values.
- All 2,427 TUI tests passed. Rebrand-sensitive checks cover wordmark geometry, narrow layouts, theme aliases, helper discovery, and reset ownership through the durable `.dux-amq-source` marker.
- The complete Rust web unit, integration, and documentation suites passed. One initial missing-worktree HTTP assertion received a transient 409; the isolated five-test suite and the complete four-thread rerun both passed without changing production code or weakening the assertions.
- The web app passed 4,796 tests across 280 files, ESLint, and its TypeScript/Vite production build. The website passed its tests and 31-page production build, including figure verification and historical-capture byte comparisons.
- The installer/overlay suite completed 159 cases: 150 executed passes and nine explicit platform skips. ShellCheck, shell syntax, local checksum fixtures, and an actual synthetic npm artifact build and host dispatch also passed. No live install or publishing was used as a test.
- A real Rust executable served the embedded app, vector logo, and generated favicon. Desktop and mobile browser checks verified the Yaran title, actual fork destination, loaded logos, copied-but-retained legacy preferences, no horizontal overflow, and no JavaScript exceptions. CLI checks reused a legacy home without changing its config bytes and confirmed new-home override precedence.
- License, historical capture, audit evidence, and the original SQL fixture were compared against pre-rebrand commit `5a90e206` and remained unchanged.

The nine shell skips require GNU `mv`, GNU `tar`, or the Linux `/data` installer fixture. Two saved-session Jcode acceptance tests require an installed Jcode plus saved replay input and remained ignored. Identity-free child-helper entries are intentionally ignored as standalone tests and are invoked by their parent tests.

Formatting, diff whitespace checks, and strict all-target workspace Clippy passed during the rebrand. The later direct-stable compiler run emitted three inherited `Atomic::fetch_update` deprecation warnings in `activity.rs` and `config_queue.rs`. Those unrelated calls were not changed to a newer API as part of the rename.

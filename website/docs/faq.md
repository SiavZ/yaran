Short questions, short answers. When a topic deserves more, the answer links to the
page that covers it in full.

## Installing & platforms

### Does yaran run on Windows?

Through WSL2, which is Linux. yaran targets macOS and Linux only; there is no
native Windows build, and WSL2 is the supported way to run it on Windows.

### What does yaran cost?

Nothing. It's open source under the MIT license. You bring your own AI CLIs and
whatever accounts they need.

### Does yaran phone home?

yaran itself sends no telemetry. It launches local CLIs in local terminals: no
analytics, no JSON-RPC, no background uploads. The one exception is opt-in: a machine you
pair with [Cloud Connect](/docs/cloud-connect) talks to your own org's control plane, in
your org's Cloudflare account, and tells it when an agent needs you.

## Agents & providers

### Which AI tools can I use?

Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Copilot are wired in out of the box, and any
other CLI that runs an interactive session in a terminal can be added. See
[Custom CLI Agents](/docs/custom-agents).

### Why was the Gemini provider removed?

[Google deprecated the Gemini CLI](https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/),
so yaran does not ship it as a built-in provider. A worktree still pinned to Gemini will
not launch: switch it to a supported provider and relaunch.

### How do I add my own CLI as an agent?

Add a `[providers.<name>]` block to your config; no adapters, no protocol layer.
See [Custom CLI Agents](/docs/custom-agents).

### Do I have to go fullscreen to type to an agent?

No. Focusing the agent's pane is enough: what you type goes to the agent right there in
the windowed layout, while yaran's own shortcuts (all modifier chords) keep working.
Fullscreen is the escape hatch for when the agent needs every key verbatim, readline
shortcuts included. The in-app help overlay shows its binding.

Tab is the one exception worth naming, because it moves between panes by default. If your
agent uses Tab to autocomplete or Shift-Tab to cycle modes, set `tab_reaches_agent = true`
under `[ui]` (or turn on "Send Tab to the agent" in the web UI's Preferences) and both
keys go to the agent in the windowed pane. `Ctrl-o` and `Ctrl-y` move between panes either
way.

### The mouse wheel or PgUp won't scroll an agent. Why?

Some agents scroll their own content, Claude Code's full-screen renderer and OpenCode
included. yaran forwards the wheel to any agent that asked for the mouse, and
`PgUp`/`PgDn` to one that took over the whole screen, and keeps its own scrollback for
agents that do neither. Windowed or fullscreen makes no difference. An explicit
`forward_scroll = true`/`false` in a `[providers.<name>]` block overrides that
detection; delete the line to return to auto-detect. See
[Custom CLI Agents](/docs/custom-agents).

The mobile web client behaves the same by touch: over a full-screen agent, a one-finger
drag and the on-screen `PgUp`/`PgDn` buttons forward to the agent. The web always
auto-detects, so `forward_scroll` applies to the terminal UI only.

### Can I start an agent from a GitHub PR?

Yes, when the `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated. See
[Creating an agent from a GitHub PR](/docs/creating-agents#creating-an-agent-from-a-github-pr).

### Do agents step on each other?

No. Each agent in a project gets its own git worktree on its own branch, so two agents
on the same project run in complete isolation. A standalone agent runs in a folder you
picked, and yaran refuses to put a second agent in a directory one is already working in,
because coding CLIs resume their conversation per directory. See
[Creating agents](/docs/creating-agents).

### Can I branch off a running agent?

Yes: fork it. yaran makes a fresh worktree from the agent's current state,
uncommitted edits included. See
[Forking an existing agent](/docs/creating-agents#forking-an-existing-agent).

### Do I need the GitHub CLI?

It is optional. Install `gh` for PR tracking, creating agents from PRs, and agent-opened
PRs; skip it and yaran quietly disables anything GitHub.

### Any recommended tools or MCP servers?

See [Recommended tools](/docs/recommended-tools) for providers, MCP servers,
and skills that pair well with yaran.

## Server mode & the browser

### Do I have to keep a terminal open to use yaran in a browser?

No. `yaran server` runs the web UI on its own, with no terminal UI in front of it, so
it is happy under `systemd`, `tmux`, or anything else that keeps a process alive. See
[Server mode overview](/docs/server-mode).

### Is there a login?

No, and that is deliberate: yaran is a single-tenant, trusted-access tool.

> [!WARNING]
> There is no password, no token, and no user accounts. Anyone who can reach the port
> gets the whole workspace, including typing into your agents. That is why it binds
> `127.0.0.1` by default. See
> [the trust model](/docs/server-mode#the-trust-model-stated-plainly).

yaran has no login of its own. If you use [Cloud Connect](/docs/cloud-connect),
Cloudflare Access is the login for that one machine address, and yaran double-checks it.

### Is server mode a hosted service? Does my code leave my machine?

Neither. There is no yaran-run service and no yaran account to make. `yaran server` is the
same binary serving a web UI from your own machine, over your own network, and your repos
never leave it. Your agents' own CLIs talk to whatever AI providers they always talk to;
yaran adds no traffic of its own. [Cloud Connect](/docs/cloud-connect) is optional, and
runs in your own organization's Cloudflare account, not in one yaran operates.

### Can I run the terminal UI and the browser at the same time?

Yes. Set `serve_while_tui = true` under `[server]`, or run the
`start-background-server` palette command, and one yaran process keeps the terminal UI in
front of you and serves the browser behind it. One device drives a given terminal at a
time and everybody else watches.

If you would rather hand the terminal over than keep it, the `start-web-server` palette
command flips a running terminal UI into serving the browser, and pressing `q` there
hands it back. Your agents keep running through every one of these transitions. See
[Three ways to serve it](/docs/server-mode#three-ways-to-serve-it).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot run two yaran processes against one config directory. The second one fails
> fast with an "already running" message.

### Can I reach it from my phone?

Yes. yaran binds your Tailscale address by default, so any device on your tailnet can
open it, and you can turn that leg on or off while yaran is serving. Read [Reaching yaran over Tailscale](/docs/tailscale) first, because there is no
login in front of the tailnet address.

There is also [a phone app](/docs/mobile-apps), with push notifications, for machines
paired through Cloud Connect.

### Do I need Cloudflare to use the phone app?

Yes. The app reaches machines only through [Cloud Connect](/docs/cloud-connect), which
runs on your organization's Cloudflare account. Without it, your phone's browser over
Tailscale gets you the same web UI, minus push notifications.

### Does Cloudflare see my code?

Yes, for anything that crosses a Cloud Connect address. Cloudflare terminates TLS at its
edge, so terminal sessions, file contents and diffs are readable there. Over Tailscale
or loopback, nothing passes through Cloudflare. See
[Security and privacy](/docs/cloud-security-privacy).

### Can I self-host the push relay?

Android normally needs no relay: Play builds use Google's push service through Google
Play services, and F-Droid and GitHub `foss` builds use whatever UnifiedPush distributor
you install. (A Play build made with the publisher's fallback push setup sends through
the publisher relay too.) iPhones get push
through the publisher relay, because only the app's publisher can send to Apple's push
service for this app. The relay is open source, and it only ever sees encrypted
notifications. See [Push notifications](/docs/push-notifications).

## Configuration

### Where does yaran keep its config and data?

`~/.config/yaran/` on Linux, `~/.yaran/` on macOS. See
[where the config lives](/docs/configuration#where-it-lives).

### Is it safe to commit my config to git?

Yes. It stores portable intent, not secrets; env values stay as `${VAR}`
references. See
[environment variables and portable paths](/docs/configuration#environment-variables-and-portable-paths).

### How do I see what I've changed, or get the latest defaults?

`yaran config diff` shows your changes; `yaran config regenerate` previews the latest
template. The summary holds back `[env]` values and project details, so it is
safe to share, but `yaran config diff --raw` prints your whole config including
those values. See
[what `yaran config diff` shows](/docs/configuration#what-yaran-config-diff-shows-and-what-it-holds-back).

### How do I run setup before an agent starts?

Give the project a `startup_command`. See
[Startup commands & environment variables](/docs/startup-commands).

### What variables can my startup scripts read?

yaran injects `YARAN_WORKTREE_PATH` and friends into every startup command. See
[the injected variables](/docs/startup-commands#yaran-injected-variables).

### What's a macro?

A reusable snippet of text you fire into an agent or a terminal with one
keystroke. See [Managing Macros](/docs/macros).

## Keybindings & themes

### How do I see every keyboard shortcut?

Open the help overlay in the terminal UI. Its key is in the footer hint bar, and the
overlay is the authoritative reference. Every binding is configurable under `[keys]`;
see [keybindings](/docs/configuration#keybindings).

### How do I change the theme?

Set `theme` under `[ui]`, or open the theme picker for a live preview. See
[changing the theme](/docs/themes#changing-the-theme).

### How do I create my own theme?

Drop a TOML file in your themes directory and point your config at it. See
[writing your own theme](/docs/themes#writing-your-own-theme).

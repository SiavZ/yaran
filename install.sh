#   2 -> the fetch itself failed, so nothing is known about whether it exists

# Check a downloaded archive against its published checksum.
#
# What this genuinely buys, stated plainly: it detects a CORRUPTED or TRUNCATED
# download, and it publishes a value you can verify by hand out of band. It is
# NOT protection against a tampered release. Anyone able to replace an archive on
# the release page can replace the checksum file sitting beside it just as
# easily, because both come from the same place over the same channel. Only
# signed artifacts would defend against that, and yaran does not sign releases yet.
#
# Outcomes:
#   * checksum present and matching  -> return 0, install proceeds
#   * checksum present and different -> exit 1, nothing is installed
#   * checksum could not be FETCHED  -> warn that the fetch failed, return 1,
#     and the caller proceeds anyway
#   * checksum genuinely absent, or no hashing tool on this machine -> warn
#     loudly and return 1, and the caller proceeds anyway
#
# The fourth argument is the fetch outcome from http_fetch_optional (0 fetched,
# 1 absent, 2 fetch failed); it defaults to 0 so a caller holding a local file
# can pass three arguments. Keeping "the fetch failed" separate from "there is no
# checksum" matters twice over: a message that blames the release for a local DNS
# failure sends the user to the wrong place, and mandatory checksums are
# impossible while the two look identical.
#
# The permissive branches are deliberate and TEMPORARY. Releases published before
# checksums existed carry no .sha256 file, and the install-script CI installs the
# real latest release, so treating a missing checksum as fatal today would break
# both installing older versions and that CI run. Once every supported release
# carries a checksum, make it mandatory by replacing the `return 1` in the "no
# published checksum" branch with a call to `err`. The fetch-failure branch
# should become an `err` at the same time (an unverifiable download is
# unverifiable whatever the reason) but it is a SEPARATE decision with a separate
# message, which is the point of splitting them. The "no hashing tool" branch
# should probably stay a warning even then, since that is a property of the
# user's machine and not of the release.
